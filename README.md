# CSIS410BRINKLEY

This is the "cloud" repository that I will be saving my Liberty University CSIS 410 B01 class Web Development Assignment on. This is set up to store and share my code with my professor, Mary Cecil at Liberty University. Please **DO NOT COPY MY CODE OR STEAL MY CODE**. 

- I have also placed the URL to my domian here - https://razorlovestocode.com/index.php .
- I, Rachel Brinkley, promise I wrote this code, line by line, not using any help or any previous code.

Again Please **DO NOT COPY MY CODE OR STEAL MY CODE**. Thank you.
