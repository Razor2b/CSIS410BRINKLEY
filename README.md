# CSIS410BRINKLEY

This is the "cloud" repository that I will be saving my Liberty University CSIS 410 B01 class Web Development Assignment on. I have included and organized each assignment week folder. This is set up to storeand share my code with my professor, Mary Cecil, to look at my code. Please **DO NOT COPY MY CODE OR STEAL MY CODE**. 

- I have also placed the URL to my domian here - *** .
- I, Rachel Brinkley, promise I wrote this code, line by line, not using any help or any previous code.

Again Please **DO NOT COPY MY CODE OR STEAL MY CODE**. Thank you.
