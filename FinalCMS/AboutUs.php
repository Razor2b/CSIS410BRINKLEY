        <p> "If you make a sale, moreover, to your friend or buy from your friendâ€™s hand, you shall not wrong one another" - Leviticus 25:14</p>
        <p>Razor's Medical Equipment is a new wave of orders, processing, and maintaining hospital equipment.
            We strive to make every step of owning medical equipment worry-free. With every order, we
            ensure that you get what you ordered and that nothing is broken.When new equipment is deliveried Razor's Medical Equipment will fully
            install and test every machine you ordered. Then, every six months, we send a small group of the maintenance team to test every produce
            to ensure everything is calibrated.
        </p>
        <p>One of our newer services is to pay on layaway for your machines. There is a layaway plan
            for everyone. Feel free to look at our catalog or we can send one of our knowledgeable sales representatives
            to your office at your convenience. They can discuss every back of the process with you. One of the main
            questions every consumer makes is whether or not the larger machines can make it into the building. i.e. having to
            tear down a wall or a door to get it in the room.
