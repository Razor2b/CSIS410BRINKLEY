Feel free to look at our catalog or we can send one of our knowledgeable sales representatives to your office at your convenience. They can discuss every back of the process with you. One of the main questions every consumer makes is whether or not the larger machines can make it into the building. i.e. having to tear down a wall or a door to get it in the room.'),

With every order, we ensure that you get what you ordered and that nothing is broken. When new equipment is delivered, Razor\'s Medical Equipment will fully install and test every machine you ordered.
